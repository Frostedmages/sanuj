**Sanuj**
A quick and terrible replacement bot for Janus in his inevitable death and downfall. A reason for me to make some easy in Python3.

**What is this?**
- Basic functionality is to capture any steam-based links and list them when called.
- Commands can be listed with qilbot help
- main used commands are qilbot lobby to list lobbies that have been captured


**TODO**
- Figure out the time differential, how long a lobby has been open rather than a random UTC String
- Give users the ability to close lobbies
- Create a restart function to allow the script to self heal if required.
